Be advised: This plugin currently migrates the `RestApi` resource to a nested stack, which causes your URL to change.

# serverless-plugin-split-stacks

The goal if this plugin is to split some resources off in to nested stacks to work around the 200 CloudFormation resource limit.

Migrating resources to nested stacks is tricky because some plugins rely on querying the resource from the main stack and would need to understand this. There are also plenty of issues with moving resources in existing deployments (you frequently get 'resource already exists' errors). Because of this, this plugin is very conservative. It moves only resources of types that seem to be easy to move.

## Stack mappings

__Default stacks migrations map is configured at plugin's constructor `stacksMap` property, and it's default configuration can be seen in [lib/stacks-map.js](https://github.com/dougmoscrop/serverless-plugin-split-stacks/blob/master/lib/stacks-map.js)__

This map can be customized. To do so, introduce the `stacks-map.js` module in a root folder of your project (this module if exists will be transparently loaded by the plugin).

Example of customization, that moves DynamoDB resources to nested stack:

```javascript
const stacksMap = require('serverless-plugin-split-stacks').stacksMap

stacksMap['AWS::DynamoDB::Table'] = { destination: 'Dynamodb' };
```

If ability to customize _static_ stacks map is not enough, then it's possible to
customize the `resolveMigration` function, one that resolves migration configuration on basis of each resource:

```javascript
const ServerlessPluginSplitStacks = require('serverless-plugin-split-stacks');

ServerlessPluginSplitStacks.resolveMigration = function (resource, logicalId, serverless) {
  if (logicalId.startsWith("Foo")) return { destination: 'Foo' };

  // Fallback to default:
  return this.stacksMap[resource.Type];
};
```

__Be careful when introducing any customizations to default config. Many kind of resources (as e.g. DynamoDB tables) cannot be freely moved between CloudFormation stacks (that can only be achieved via full removal and recreation of the stage)__

### Pre-configured customizations

#### Nested stack per lambda

If nested stack per lambda seems a right choice for your Serverless projects. This is a customization to consider.

__Note: Switch from default serverless stack handling to nested stack per lambda approach will most likely require complete removal of a stage (stack) and new deployment with this configuration in. It's due to fact that CloudFormation (at this point) doesn't support move of resources between stacks.__

To load it configure `stacks-map.js` content as follows:

```javascript
require('serverless-plugin-split-stacks/customizations/stack-per-lambda');

```

## Limitations

You should try to limit the number of functions you have in your service to 20 or so. This plugin is not a substitute for fine-grained services - but even with a domain of a single entity and sub-entity, CRUD operations on each and some stream listeners its easy to exceed 200 resources once monitoring is in place.
